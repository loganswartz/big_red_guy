A "Secret Santa" manager written in Rust.

# About

The goal of this is to allow creating "parties", where several people can
connect together, add their Christmas lists, and then mark things off of other
people's lists so that people don't double-buy items.

# Misc

I started this as a pet project to learn Rust, so there will be a lot of
improvements to be made.
